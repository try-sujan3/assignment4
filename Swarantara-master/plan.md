# Plan to Update package.json

This plan outlines the steps to update the `package.json` file as requested.

## Steps

1.  **Gather Information (Completed):** Read the existing `package.json` file to get its current content.
2.  **Formulate Changes (Completed):** Create a diff representing the necessary changes to dependencies and devDependencies.
